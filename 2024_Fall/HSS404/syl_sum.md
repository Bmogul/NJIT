## Course Desc Abrdiged
Goal of the course is to create an understaning of the place of health and medicine in this increasingly globalized world. With the ability to go anywhere in the world within a few days time, or even communicating across the entire planet with the use of the internet, health and medicine has adapted to this globalizatoin along with everything else. People accross the world travel to different locations for medical assistance due to various different reasons, being treated locally is no longer the only option and people have notcied this. The rise of "medical tourism" along with "cultural competency" in healthcare will be studied along with the conflicts that come along with these topics.

Note: pluses and minuses will be given for assignments, Final grades do not contain Minuses and will be rounded to nearest letter grade or Plus per NJIT’s policies. My habit is a tendency to grade harshly, to round down rather than up, on assignments, and to round up if close to letter grades on the final grade due to the lack of the “minus” modifier option.

Attendance: 1-2 unexuced, not harshly graded, will take into account class performance
