## Security concepts

*PRG* or psuedo random generators
    - Statistical test on {0,1}^n
        - an algorithm A s.t. A(X) outputs 
            0 if not random
            1 if it looks random
        - A(X) = 1 iff | # 0(x) - # 1(x) | <= 10(n)^(1/2)
        - A(X) = 1 iff | # 00(x) - (n/4) | <= 10(n)^(1/2)
        - A(X) = 1 iff | max-run-of-0(X) | <= 10log_2(n)
    - G:K -> {0,1}^n is a secure PRG if for all efficient statistical test A 
        PRGAdv[A,G] is negligible

*PRG Advantage*:    let G : K -> {0,1}^n and A is a statistsical test on {0,1}^n
                    then define
                        PRGAdv[A,G] = |Pr[A(G(k)) = 1] - Pr[A(r) = 1]|
Would like PRGAdv to be close to 0 as it means that it looks very random

ADV -> 0 then A cant distinguish G from random
ADV -> 1 then A can distinguish G from random

EX: Let G:K -> {0,1}^n be a secure PRG
Define H:K -> {0,1}^n s.t.
    H(X) = G(X) || G(X)
Is H a secure PRG ? No
how to prove?
define some statistical test A s.t. (create statistical test same as H(X))
     A(X) = 1 if        x = y || y
            0 otherwise 
PGRAdv(A,H) = |Pr[A(H(k)) = 1] - Pr[A(r) = 1]|
    k exists in K
    r exists in {0,1}^2n
since H(k) is in form of x = y || y hen A(H(k)) = 1
and A(r) = 1/2^n as proability that r is in form y || y or made up of two y's is 1/2^n
    = |1 - (1/2^n)|

**FACT: A secure PRG is unpredictable**
PRG predictable means it is insecure

#Proof Idea: Suppose A is an efficient algo s.t.
    pr[A(G(k)|1,...,i) = G(k)|i+1] = 1/2 + e
    
    define statistical test B as 
    B(X) =  1 if A(X|1,...,i) = xi+1
            0 otherwse

    PRGAdv = |1/2+e-1/2| -> non negligble -> not secure

*Theorem*: An unperdictable PRG is secure

Let P1 and P2 be two distributions over {0,1}^n that are
computationally indistinguishable if for all efficient statistical tests A
Pr([A(X) = 1]) - Pr([A(X) = 1]) < negligble
x exists in P1      x exists in P2

IND-CPA secure
implies randomized algorithm
deterministic algo means not IND-CPA
