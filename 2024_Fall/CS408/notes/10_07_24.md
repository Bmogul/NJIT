## Semantic Security
more practical than perfect security
    - ciphertext should reveal no infomation about PT

Game

For b=0,1 define experiments
Exp(0), Exp(1)
    
Challenger  C
Adversary   A

A sends two messages, m0, m1 where |m0| = |m1| to C

C chooses k from Key spac and encrypts one of the two, CT= Rk(mb) where b is 0 || 1

than A guesses b as b' exists in {0,1}

if A guesses correctly A wins, else loses.
