## Course Desc Abrdiged
Course intended to be an introduction to cryptography and internet security, covering basic security concepts together with prnciples of secure communication over the internet. 
Topics to be covered in course are classical cryptosystems, block and stream ciphers, public-key cryptography, random number generation, digital signatures, auth protocols, Kerberos, SSL, IPsec, and Web and Internet Security
Goal is for students to understand main types of attacks that may occur in computer and network systems, understnad various models that evaluate security of cryptographic, assess level of security provided by cryptographic protocols and build new cryptogrpahics protocols to achieve security guarntees for a diverse set of real world scenarios.
